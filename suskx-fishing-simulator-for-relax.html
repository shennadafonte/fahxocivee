In the last two years I've organized a vote for annual Best of Game Grumps Awards (dubbed "The Burgies). While a year was spent in hospitals and doctors' offices with my grandfather and the next year he was the first of several blows to the family that led to me picking up a lot of slack, I wish to pick up this year where I left off. The Grammys were Sunday, and the Oscars are in the coming weeks. It's award season! So let's I used the leaked Steam data to compile a list of VR games and owners. The name links to the respective Steam store page. ampnbsp; Keep in mind, data was only leaked for games with achievements. This list was largely automated and only includes pure VR games (Games with a "VR headset required" notice on the store page). If you notice one missing, let me know and I'll add it. #Updates July 7, 14:57 UTC Added Space Pirate Trainer and Fallout 4 VR. ampnbsp; July 7, 15:03 UTC Added. 
Hello Everyone, I frequently see questions about what to do around the coast, in here I will attempt to keep a running list of ideas. Some things are in multiple areas e.g. Fresh food markets/live music so I haven't listed every individual item, if you see something that that interests you try googling to see if there's one in your area! Starting from North GC then moving south you have: Pimpama/Ormeau(ish): ~~Get an icecream at the Strawberry Farm (https://www.facebook.com/TheStr. Hiho, I'm looking for a new MMORPG which has the following aspects: Very chill as in relaxing gameplay where there is enough to do that isn't hardcore PvP, Raiding etc. Open World to explore, filled with nice things everywhere like WoW or Black Desert or GW2 as I heared. Side Activities like Black Desert Online, Fishing, Sailing, Gathering and Minigames that are just fun. But not exactly a Production simulator or something where I have to scroll through spreadsheet after spread. ampnbsp; #### YESTERDAY'S POST CAN BE FOUND HERE - 12/03/18 (https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/8410jk/switch_101_daily_news_120318_switch_os_50/) ampnbsp; ampnbsp; # Game Releases: ampnbsp; #### Coffin Dodgers - EU/NA Release - ‚Ç¨12.99 .99 ¬£9.99 - eShop Link (https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/coffin-dodgers-switch) - Website ( - Trailer (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAI0lvRMB0Q) - Metacritic (http://www.

Birds chirping, sun shining, fish jumping, just being in nature, aah. How come this doesn't exist yet? I thought this would be one of the pretty early things in VR. A full perfect and awesomely immersive fishing game like that, I'd pay 0 for it. I really want something to relax in using my vive, I can't find any decent games/experiences to relax in. Sitting on a mountain or in space isn't really my thing. Just imagine. This is the ultimate power. okay no seriously lol ampnbsp; I have had ideas for a Sonic fan/indie game for a very long time now. Any Sonic fans are welcome to throw some ideas down onto the plate (I need some anyway.) Heck, even throw an opinion or two down. I tried my best when it came to brainstorming. But to be honest, I don't know very many characters as well as I know the Blue Blur himself. Still, the entire point of this game is to please as many fans as possible (no matter </p>
